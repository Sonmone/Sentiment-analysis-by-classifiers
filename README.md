# Sentiment analysis by classifiers
Introduction
---------------
  
The code is based on Python3.5. To run this project, the current computer needs to install Python3.5 or higher Python Version.
There are three .py scripts in the root directory: nb.py adopts the method of naïve bayes classifier to do evaluation, knn.py adopts the method of k-nearest neighbors classifier to do evaluation, tester.py adopts the method of naïve bayes classifier to generate predicted labels.<br/>

Compilation
---------------

Run these three .py scripts in IDLE (windows) or in command directly.<br/>
  
Files
---------------
  
In the root directory, there are three .py executable scripts; COMP90049-2018S1_proj2-data file includes raw resource used to train and test classifiers; <br/>
Results file includes the output of each method and prediction.txt is the output for test_raw.txt.<br/>
  
Output
---------------
  
The prediction.txt is the output of the testing raw source, which is produced by Naïve Bayes classifier.
